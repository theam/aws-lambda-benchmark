# Hello world Example
In this example we will just deploy manually a function in AWS Lambda with our desired runtime. Some of the runtimes will be custom, as a result, it will require a bit more work.

Note: We have tested all these functions with 1028 MB of memory

## Runtime Index
- [Nodejs 8.10](#nodejs-810)
- [Python 3.6](#python-36)
- [Java](#java)
- [Rust](#rust)
- [Haskell (Layer)](#Haskell-with-custom-runtime)
- [Haskell (Runtime Bootstrapped)](#Haskell-runtime-Bootstrapped)
- [Go](#go)

## Setting up Lambda IAM Role

We need to create a very basic IAM Role that we will assign to each of the functions we create. We will go to `IAM Role` in the AWS Console to get started.

In order to allow logging we will add the following `CloudWatch Logs` permissions to the IAM role:
```
logs:CreateLogStream
logs:CreateLogGroup
logs:PutLogEvents
```

Additionally, we will also need to define a `Trust Relationships` in order to allow API Gateway to invoke our function:
```
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": [
          "apigateway.amazonaws.com",
          "lambda.amazonaws.com"
        ]
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Nodejs 8.10
- Create a `Function from Scratch` and choose a name for the function, e.g. `benchmark-nodejs-hello`
- Choose the correct runtime `Node.js 8.10`
- Select the `execution role` that you just created above
- Click `Create the function`
- Paste the following code
```
exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) => {

    var response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify("hello"),
        isBase64Encoded: false
    };
    
    callback(null, response)
};

```
- Input the `Handler`
`index.handler`
- `Save` and Test the event by clicking `Test` in the top right corner

## Python 3.6
- Create a `Function from Scratch` and choose a name for the function, e.g. `benchmark-python-hello`
- Choose the correct runtime `Python 3.6`
- Select the `execution role` that you just created above
- Click `Create the function`
- Paste the following code

```
exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) => {

    var response = {
        statusCode: 200,
        body: JSON.stringify("hello"),
        isBase64Encoded: false
    };
    
    callback(null, response)
};
```

- Input the `Handler`
`lambda_function.lambda_handler`
- `Save` and Test the event by clicking `Test` in the top right corner

## Java
- First of all, install [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- Change directory to `examples/hello-world/java`
- Build the project, `gradle build`
- Go to `AWS Lambda` in AWS Console
- Create new function from Scratch
- Enter function name and select `Java 8` as runtime
- Choose the execution role we created above
- `Upload the zip file benchmarks-java-dev-all.jar` we created as function code
- Input `com.theagilemonkeys.labs.HelloWorldHandler` as the `Handler`
- Click `Save`
- Test the function by clicking `Test` in the top right corner

## Rust
- First of all, install [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html) and `musl-cross` `brew install filosottile/musl-cross/musl-cross`
- Set link: `ln -s /usr/local/bin/x86_64-linux-musl-gcc /usr/local/bin/musl-gcc`
- Change directory to `examples/hello-world/rust`
- Build function: `cargo build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`
- Zip function: `zip -j rust.zip ./target/x86_64-unknown-linux-musl/release/bootstrap`
- Go to `AWS Lambda` in AWS Console
- Create new function from Scratch
- Enter function name and select `Provide your own bootstrap`
- Choose the execution role we created above
- `Upload the zip file rust.zip` we created as function code and click `save`
- Test the function by clicking `Test` in the top right corner

## Haskell with custom runtime
- First of all, install [Stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/)
- Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- Download Docker Stack image `docker pull fpco/stack-build:lts-13.25`
- build project by running `make` in `examples/hello-world/haskell-with-layer`
- Go to `AWS Lambda` in AWS Console
- Create new function from Scratch
- Enter function name and select `Provide your own bootstrap`
- Choose the execution role we created above
- `Upload the zip file function.zip` located in `./build` as function code
- Enter `src/Lib.handler` as the `Handler`
- Click on `Layers` and add `arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:785355572843:layer:aws-haskell-runtime:6`
- Click `Save` and then Test the function by clicking `Test` in the top right corner
